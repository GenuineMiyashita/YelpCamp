# YelpCamp 2023

YelpCamp was the capstone project from Colt Steele's "Web Developer Bootcamp 2023" that I took on Udemy. It was a combination of all the topics that was covered through the course, alongside some additional features. These topics include the basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for the frontend, meanwhile, Express and MongoDB was used for the backend. The capstone project included geo-location, databases, authentication, authorization, sanitization, etc through the means of mongoose, ejs, passport, multer, joi, helmet, etc.

Throughout this course, I learned a ton about the fullstack experience and have the tools to continue honing my skills.
